# byte's blender assets

I've been putting a lot of work into my personal blender asset library lately, and since all of it is CC-0 (public domain) I figured I'd go ahead and make it available for others to use if they want. I'm trying to attribute stuff anyway in the asset metadata (when I can find the source), but everything in this collection was made available as CC-0.

This project is still pretty new, so expect the organization of stuff to change. As such, if you do use this library, you'll probably want to append assets instead of linking them, since links are liable to break in future updates.
